Video player project developed by group 48.

In this project we (group 48) have applied our knowledhe of user interfaces in order to design, evaluate and develop a complex GUI application in Qt The project is based on a scenario where we as a group had to create a prototype of a video player that would be presented at a senior leadership team meeting. After many iterations, we have finally arrived at a prototype that is worthy of being presented. This app is suitable for mobiles and tablets, as well as desktop.

This folder also contains resources for button icons and videos for playback in the player itself
